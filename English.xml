  <THE_PREMISE>Scientists have detected a strange signal originating from the ZZ-Omega-9 system.

Could it be the power source that will save civilization?

It is your mission to investigate, and return with that information.

Good luck, pilot!</THE_PREMISE>
  <STORY_MADLIBS>
    <string>Built in a %workshop state% shipyard, your ship was the pride and joy of a %person desc% engineer.
It has %color% detailing and an unusually-shaped %ship part%.</string>
    <string>Modeled after a popular %ship type% from %corporation name%, the ship you've been assigned for this mission is unusually %size%, and features a striking %color% paint job.</string>
    <string>Once owned by the infamous pirate %pirate name%, your ship received heavy modifications for this mission, but still sports its original %color% stripes.</string>
    <string>Though %size% for a fighter, your ship was designed by brilliant military minds.
Simple, %color% detailing runs along each side of its metallic frame.</string>
    <string>Yours is one of many %ship type%s made by %corporation name%. It features their signature %color% stripes and %size% %ship part%.</string>
    <string>Your %relative%, a %person desc% %job title%, passed away unexpectedly %small number% years ago. You'd had a falling out after you joined the military, so you were even more surprised to learn that they had left you their ship: this %size%, %color% %ship type% from %corporation name%.</string>
    <string>You took some odd jobs during your military tour in order to buy your own ship: this %size% beauty from %corporation name%.
Getting the custom-desgined %ship part% to match the ship's %color% paint job was surprisingly expensive, but well worth it!</string>

  <TUTORIAL_SOMETHING_IS_WRONG_2>I've put us in orbit around a small, icy dwarf planet. While I run some ship diagnostics, can you explore for something we can use as fuel?</TUTORIAL_SOMETHING_IS_WRONG_2>
  <TUTORIAL_SCHEMATICS>These look like designs for some kind of alien ship. Interesting...

We should definitely take a closer look at these later, but for now we really need fuel.</TUTORIAL_SCHEMATICS>
  <TUTORIAL_FUEL>At least we can salvage the fuel it had.</TUTORIAL_FUEL>
  <MYSTERIOUS_FORCE_EXPLANATION>Captain, I've identified the source of our fuel problems: something within the ZZ-Omega-9 sector itself is warping space, creating a constant drag effect. It's going to cost us 3 Fuel to jump from system to system, and we're already almost out.</MYSTERIOUS_FORCE_EXPLANATION>
  <MYSTERIOUS_FORCE_EXPLANATION_2>If we're to succeed in our mission, we will need to stop at whatever planets we can find, and extract at least 3 Fuel from each.</MYSTERIOUS_FORCE_EXPLANATION_2>
  <APPROACH_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE>Captain, we're here!

I'll send some probes immediately.</APPROACH_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE>
  <EXPLAIN_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE>That device... it's incredible that something so old could contain such power.

Do the inhabitents of this sector even realize that it's here?</EXPLAIN_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE>
  <EXPLAIN_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE_2>Whatever the case, we must get this information back home.

Let's get out of the ZZ-Omega-9 sector, and into Deep Space.</EXPLAIN_MYSTERIOUS_SOURCE_2>
